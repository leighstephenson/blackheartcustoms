Edit information

Things to start with:
-Need to determine how my images will be incorporated. Might just start with storing images in the public folder so that I can work on the rest of the functionality. 
-Need to compile information about each kit that will be featured: Wolfman, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, Cyclops, Medusa or Gorgon, The Thing. 
-Need to think about if I want to feature only large scale kits or microMANIA too. To start I think only large scale. 
-Will need reducers for selecting the kit details, selecting an existing kit to edit, editing information. More to determine.
-Need to rework the routes and navigation
