Upload images
Edit existing kits
Edit information

Things to start with:
-Need to determine how my images will be incorporated. Might just start with storing images in the public folder so that I can work on the rest of the functionality. 
-Need to compile information about each kit that will be featured: Wolfman, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, Cyclops, Medusa or Gorgon, The Thing. 
-Need to think about if I want to feature only large scale kits or microMANIA too. To start I think only large scale. 
-Will need reducers for selecting the kit details, selecting an existing kit to edit, editing information. More to determine.
-Need to rework the routes and navigation

I have all my pages and components built, only big thing left for CRUD functionality is to implement the AWS S3 bucket for adding and storing images. After that: styling, finishing adding content, and stretch goals.

Things to do for base mode:
-Implement AWS
-Rework my code to include "photos" table
-Fix navigation styling
-Add content to contact page
-STYLE
-Add social media links to footer too

Only real issue that I'm still having, is that my uploaded images are going to the 2nd to last addition to the database, not the last. 

List of more stuff to do:
-Complete styling, finalize nav styling
-Fix image upload issue
-Add photos/more content to about and contact page
-Finish adding kit info to database, add any additional photos
-Add icons to some buttons maybe?
-Swap history.push for history.goBack on all back buttons
-Differentiate "delete kit" button- make red or something to stand out 
-progress bar for adding a new kit maybe?

Stuff to do before deploying:
-Format for web viewers, set max sizes for all images,
