          This app was created by me, Leigh Stephenson, for my Prime Digital Academy solo project.
          I knew from the beginning that I wanted to create something
          that would also benefit the family business. I've watched Black Heart expand so much from the
          beginning and it has been amazing that grown to where it is now. I'm really proud of this 
          business that my dad has built and will take every opportunity to support it.
